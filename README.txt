––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––

JoinHere is an offline, remixable starter pack.
Feel free to adapt it — but please don’t pretend you invented it.

You may change:

The logo (just replace the image file, keep the name)
The first group (in register.html)
The default friend (also in register.html)
The email rotation (in index.html)
The random page list (in index.html)
The site title and footer (in index.html, register.html, and the 6 form pages)
You don’t need to update every single profile manually —
just edit the main templates above, then use the register form to generate new versions.

You don’t need permission —
but if you believe in the vision, we’d love for you to build with us, not next to us.
📧 hello@joinhere.group

✅ Do:

Credit the origin in a way that feels right to you:

Help others build a better internet
🚫 Don’t:
Sell it without adding value
Remove all references and claim it’s yours
