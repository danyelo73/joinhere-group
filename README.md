## 🔧 Customize JoinHere

You may change:

- The logo (replace the image file)  
- First group + default friend in `register.html`  
- Email rotation & random page list in `index.html`  
- Titles & footers across the core pages  

Just regenerate via `register.html`.  
No permission required — but if you believe in the vision, build **with us**, not next to us.
